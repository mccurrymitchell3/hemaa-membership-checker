HEMAA Membership Checker

This web application is meant to verify a user's membership status by taking an inputed email address and matching it to a user in TidyHQ's database. Using TidyHQ's APIs, this application does not have to store or edit data. It instead only requests the data to verify membership. All of the membership validation code is located in [main.py]('./main.py').
